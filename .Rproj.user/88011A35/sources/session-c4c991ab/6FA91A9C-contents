# About me

I am a researcher in English linguistics at Chemnitz University of Technology, working in the areas of second language perception and production, corpus linguistics and academic writing. My PhD project used evidence from experiments with electroencephalography (EEG) to study the perception of word stress cues by speakers of Slavonic Englishes. My thesis also presented phonetic and phonological analyses on Czech English features and proposed a concept for a tool for training perception and production of segmentals and suprasegmentals following the High-Variability Perceptual Training method. I am currently investigating how researchers use metaphors in science communication to present knowledge in a new context and simplify it for a general audience. The complexity of foreign language acquisition drives me to explore it in its various contexts and to share these insights with others.
